Version a2.10

NOTE: The INSTALL.INO file can be edited and updated.

These are all used in the Arduino Automatic Two-function Floor Cleaner research project.

# Current Status of this Project
- The paper is finally here! Feel free to use this study as part of your related study or as a basis for improving this paper/product.
- The body.pdf and header.pdf are the research paper parts.
- The first pages are the header.pdf, then body.pdf.
- I don't think I can update the INSTALL.INO file anymore, as when another science investigatory project appears, I will focus on an  different product that is still based on the Arduino and open-source parts.
